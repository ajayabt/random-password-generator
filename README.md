# Console Finances 


## Description

This is my first javascript challenge which takes a sample set of financial data with months and corresponding profit.

The instructions were as follow:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`)

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
