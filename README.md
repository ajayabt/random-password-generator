# Random Password Generator


## Description

This is a password generator developed for my bootcamp challenge. The starter code included the full HTML and CSS files as well as some of the javascript functionality such as the button triggering. All starter code is commented as well as the code which I developed myself.

## Usage

## Credits
Starter code comes from the bootcamp team and is commented in the javascript file. As mentioned, the HTML and CSS is a part of the starter file. Thank you to the bootcamp instructors and TAs who have enabled me to get this far!
